# PrimitiveCollisions

A package to check intersections between (currently just a few 2D) geometric primitives. To get started, check `shapes.jl` and `collisions.jl`. Designed primarily for usage in [Collide.jl](https://github.com/AayushSabharwal/Collide.jl).

All versions prior to 0.6.0 are testing versions, not designed for usage and are not guaranteed to even precompile.
